## Looking into integrating Search Guard to Kibana

`In the following description, we assume that you have already set up a Search Guard secured Elasticsearch cluster. Weâ€™ll walk through all additional steps needed for integrating Kibana with your setup.`  

`We also assume that you have enabled TLS support on the REST layer via Search Guard SSL. While this is optional, we strongly recommend using this feature. Otherwise, traffic between Kibana and Elasticsearch is made via unsecure HTTP calls, and thus can be sniffed.`  

~~To my best knowledge, Eino is working on the previously mentioned requirements, so I will start looking into securing Kibana. At a later stage we will merge our work into a working solution.~~
Scratch that, it would seem like I have to start working on implementing Search Guard to Elasticsearch first.
