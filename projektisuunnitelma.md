**Multidisciplinary Software Project, fall 2018**  

### Project background

The subject of our multidisciplinary software project is the collection and analysis of log data in a local network. The goal is to automate and centralize control, and to create a comprehensive view of security for the uninitiated users. We believe the project supports our other courses and the ICT-infrastructure oriented studies. Out team is also interested in cyber security, so the project has a direct link to working life and future employment.

Our purpose is to create a complete product, that utilizes the Elastic -software stack, for the small and medium sized companies. Additionally, the installation and usage of said package is to be  easy and effortless. Our additional milestone is to replace some heavy components of the stack with lighter counterparts. There is also the potential benefit of creating a package to be sold to companies.

### Project goals 

1) Log data collection, control ja analysis in a small network.  
2) Encrypted traffic between clients and host.
3) Recognition of exceptions and anomalies in the data.  
4) Representing data in easily understandable form.  

### Project steps and milestones

The first step of our project is the installation of ELK-stack and processing of log data on a single computer.  
The following milestones are:  
1) Centralized control of multiple computers' log data.  
2) Automated setup of client computers via SALT.  
3) Replacing components that are either non-open source (Beats) or use large quantities of recources (such as Logstash).  

By using the school's lab network, we can simulate a normal working enviroment. On a personal level, our aim is to learn to identify relevant log data and get familiar with the tools we're using.  
Our project requires requires strict scheduling and documentation. The latter of which is achieved by uploading everything to Github. Our team is slightly smaller than what we're used to, and this will bring it's own advantages and challenges.

### Project organization and stakeholders 
 
The project is owned by our team.  
The project manager and secretary are yet to be appointed (Saku and Eino most likely).  
Project supervisors: Harto Holmström and Tero Karvinen.  

At this point in time the stakeholders consist of other project groups and our supervisors. At later stages of the production we wish to work with some companies that would pilot our project.

### Budget and schedule

Working hours previously updated in Onedrive Sharepoint. We're relocation said task to Github.  

**Week**|**Task**
--------|-------------
Week 34|Project kick off
Week 37|Presenting project plan
Week 49|Completetion of final report.
Week 50|Presenting project

Manhours included in the budget: 

-17h / week / person = 817h (Project management 20%) 

### Risks and requirements

Requirements: Access to Servula hardware, scheduling, communication between group members.  
Risks: Unforeseen technical difficulties, members falling sick, too ambitious goals.  

### Work plan  

Look schedule in github.com/jisosomppi/log-analysis/blob/master/schedule.md

### Communication
We'll be mostly using the "from mouth to ear" -system. To comply this we've a WhatsApp group to agree on meetings and inform of possible delays or absence from meetings.
